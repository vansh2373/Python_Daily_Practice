You're helping with a digital toll booth system. Every vehicle has a 4-digit number plate, and the toll system has a special rule:

ğŸ“Œ Only vehicles with palindromic 4-digit numbers that are even and divisible by 11 can use the FastLane (a fast pass gate).

Your task:
ğŸ”¹ From the list of vehicle numbers, print all the ones eligible for FastLane.

approach that i will follow
1 -- taking 4 digit input num 
2 -- if num not a 4 digit or > 4 digit then terminate the program as it can't pass the toll gate 
3 -- if yes then applying conditions 4 digit%2==0,4digitnum%11==0
4 -- printing fastverified no in a single line usind end =" ".
5 -- if no numbers are 4 digit then print No fastlane Vehicles.
